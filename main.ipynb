    "This project is a machine learning task focused on classifying Rocket League trickshots based on gameplay data. The goal is to predict the type of trickshot performed using features like player and ball movements, speeds, and control inputs, with classes split evenly in the dataset. I built a model to accurately identify these shots, processing the data to capture key patterns and testing different algorithms to find the best performer. The final submission is a set of predictions on a test dataset, formatted for evaluation. My approach aimed to balance simplicity and effectiveness, ensuring robust results for this university assignment."

    "I started by loading the training and test datasets from CSV files since they were already prepared for the Rocket League trickshot classification task. My goal was to get a quick sense of the data's structure and quality before diving into preprocessing. I used pandas to read the files and checked the training data with info(), head(), and describe() to understand the columns, data types, and basic statistics. I also looked at the label distribution to confirm the classes were balanced. Checking for missing values and unique counts of categorical columns helped me spot any potential issues early, like nulls or high-cardinality features that might complicate modeling. I ran a correlation check on numeric columns to see if any features were strongly related, which could guide feature selection later. This initial step was about building a solid foundation for the rest of the project.\n",

I wrote a function to run 5-fold cross-validation on the training set to get a robust sense of how each model performs, then trained and tested on the validation set to see real results.

I tuned it with grid search, testing different tree counts, depths, and splits, settling on the best combo for macro F1 to ensure solid per-class performance. For data processing, I split the timestamped and summary data to handle them separately, aggregating the timestamped part with rules like last values for distances and means for actions to capture trickshot patterns concisely. I merged in skew features to add context, then split the data with stratification to keep the class balance. This approach kept the dataset manageable and focused on key shot dynamics, which helped the model learn effectively without unnecessary complexity. Working on this project was a great experience - I really enjoyed the challenge and had fun putting it all together."
